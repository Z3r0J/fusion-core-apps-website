## Privacy Policy for FusionCore Apps

**Last Updated:** August 12, 2025

Thank you for using apps developed by **FusionCore Apps** (“we”, “our”, “us”).  
This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our Bible-focused apps and this website. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about the data we collect.

## 1. Information We Collect

- **Expo Push Token (Device/App Identifier)**  
  If you **enable notifications**, the app requests permission. When granted, we generate an **Expo push token** for your device/app instance. This token is used **only** to route push notifications to your device.

> We **do not** collect your name, email, precise location, contacts, or other personal/sensitive information.

### Information Processed Locally (Not Collected by Us)

- **Device language** – to display content in your preferred language.
- **Color/theme preference** – e.g., light/dark mode.

These preferences are stored **locally on your device** and are not transmitted to our servers.

### Data Collected by Third-Party Ad Networks (When Ads Are Shown)

If an app shows ads, third-party ad networks (e.g., **Google AdMob**) may collect certain information independently to personalize and measure ads, such as:

- **Advertising identifiers** (e.g., Android Advertising ID)
- **Approximate location** (for region-based ads)
- **Device and usage signals** (e.g., coarse device info, engagement with ads)

We do **not** control what those networks collect directly; please review their policies (see Section 3).

## 2. How We Use Information

- **Provide language-specific content** and remember your **appearance preferences**.
- **Send push notifications** that you opt into (daily verses, updates, important notices) using the Expo push token.
- **Show non-intrusive ads** in free apps via third-party ad networks (where applicable).
- **Basic aggregated metrics** (e.g., ad impressions/clicks reported by the ad network) to improve app performance.

We do **not** sell or rent data.

## 3. Sharing of Information

- **Ads & Delivery Providers**  
  To deliver ads and notifications:
  - **Google AdMob (Ads/Measurement)** – see:
    - [Google AdMob Program Policies](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543)
    - [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
    - [Google Ads – Advertising Policies & Technologies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
  - **Expo Push Service** & **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** (for Android delivery):
    - [Firebase Privacy & Security](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

  These providers use the information (e.g., ad identifiers; your **Expo/FCM token**) **solely** to perform their services (ad serving/measurement or notification delivery).

- **No Sale of Data**  
  We do **not** sell or share your data with advertisers, marketers, or other third parties outside the services listed above.

- **Legal Compliance**  
  We may disclose information if required to do so by law (e.g., subpoena, court order).

## 4. Data Security

We apply reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect data in transit and at rest. Preferences like language/theme are stored locally on your device; access is governed by your device’s security settings.

## 5. Your Rights & Choices

- **Notifications**: Disable notification permission in your device settings at any time (this stops generation/use of your Expo push token).
- **Ads Personalization**: Opt out via your device settings (Android “Ads”/“Ad Personalization”) and your Google account’s Ads Settings.
- **Location**: Revoke approximate location permission in system settings if previously allowed.
- **Uninstall**: Removing the app deletes locally stored preferences on your device.
- **Data Deletion Request**: Email **jeanrey.ese@gmail.com** and we will remove push tokens we control associated with your device/app instance.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Our apps are suitable for a general audience and **do not knowingly collect data from children under 13**. If you believe a child has provided information, contact us and we will delete it.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be posted here with a new **Last Updated** date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
